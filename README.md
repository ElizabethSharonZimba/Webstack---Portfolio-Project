Project Overview

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project is a web-based implementation of the Hangman game, designed with a front-end for user interaction and a back-end API for game logic.
Features

    Guess letters to uncover a randomly chosen word.
    Track remaining guesses and letters already guessed.
    Win the game by guessing all letters or lose if guesses run out.
    Reset the game and start with a new word anytime.
    Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.

Technologies Used
Front-end

    HTML: Structure of the web page.
    CSS: Styling and layout.
    JavaScript: Game logic and interaction with the back-end API.

Back-end

    Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
    Express.js: Framework for building the back-end API.

Development Tools

    Git: Version control.
    Visual Studio Code: Code editor.
    Postman: For testing API endpoints.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

    Node.js installed on your machine.
    A browser to run the front-end.

Steps

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone  https://github.com/ElizabethSharonZimba/Webstack---Portfolio-Project.git
cd hangman-game

Install dependencies: In the project directory, run the following command:

bash

npm install

Start the back-end server:

bash

    node server.js

    Run the front-end: Open index.html in your browser.

    The back-end will run on http://localhost:3000, and the front-end will connect to it automatically.

Usage

    Start the Game: Once the front-end is loaded, a word will be chosen at random, and youâ€™ll see underscores representing the hidden word.
    Make a Guess: Enter a letter and press "Guess." The game will reveal any correct guesses in the word or reduce the remaining guesses if the letter is incorrect.
    Win or Lose: You win by guessing all letters before running out of guesses. You lose if all guesses are used up.
    Reset the Game: Click "Reset Game" to start a new round with a new word.

Game Logic

    Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a predefined list when the game starts.
    Guesses: Players have a total of 6 incorrect guesses before they lose the game.
    Letter Validation: The game checks if a guessed letter is in the word and updates the display accordingly.
    Game End: The game ends when:
        All letters are correctly guessed (win).
        The player runs out of guesses (loss).

Future Improvements

Some possible enhancements include:

    Word Difficulty Levels: Add easy, medium, and hard words based on length or complexity.
    Multiplayer Mode: Allow two players to take turns guessing letters.
    Themes: Add different themes to the game, like animals, countries, or movies.
    Score Tracking: Implement a database to save high scores or player stats.
