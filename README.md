Project Overview
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player guesses a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project is a web-based implementation of the Hangman game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end logic.

Features
Guess letters to uncover a randomly chosen word.
Track remaining guesses and letters already guessed.
Win by guessing all letters or lose if guesses run out.
Reset the game and start with a new word anytime.
Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.
Technologies Used
Front-end & Back-end:

HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Handles both game logic and user interaction.
Development Tools
Git: Version control.
Visual Studio Code: Code editor.
Browser Console: For testing and debugging the game.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
A browser to run the game.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ElizabethSharonZimba/Webstack---Portfolio-Project.git
cd hangman-game
Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.

Usage
Start the Game: When the page loads, a random word is selected, represented by underscores.
Make a Guess: Type a letter and press "Guess." The game will reveal any correct guesses or reduce the remaining guesses if incorrect.
Win or Lose: You win by guessing all letters before running out of guesses, or you lose if all guesses are used up.
Reset the Game: Click "Reset Game" to start a new round with a new word.
Game Logic
Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a predefined list when the game starts.
Guesses: Players have 6 incorrect guesses before they lose the game.
Letter Validation: The game checks if a guessed letter is in the word and updates the display accordingly.
Game End: The game ends when:
All letters are correctly guessed (win).
The player runs out of guesses (loss).
Future Improvements
Word Difficulty Levels: Add easy, medium, and hard words based on length or complexity.
Multiplayer Mode: Allow two players to take turns guessing letters.
Themes: Add themes such as animals, countries, or movies.
Score Tracking: Implement a database to save high scores or player stats.
